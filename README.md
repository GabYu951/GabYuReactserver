Welcome to the BotPack🌀 repository. This project is an unofficial bot file from the Mirai Repository, initially developed and maintained by Phạm Văn Diện, better known as D-Jukie. The base file for this project is sourced from the Disme-Bot GitHub project.

BotPack🌀 is a modified messenger bot file by Yan Maglinte🇵🇭. It is a refined version of the Mirai messenger bot, with some unique enhancements.

A key feature is the usePrefix function integrated within every command. This function removes the need for prefixes, providing a more streamlined user experience. Alongside ready-made commands and free-to-edit codes, this bot file encourages users to learn and explore freely.


Further, BotPack🌀 comes with a user-friendly feature that allows easy customization of your console design via the theme option in the config.json file. This makes it highly accessible, especially for beginners.


Embrace the world of possibilities with BotPack🌀 - a facebook Messenger file designed to make your interaction with messenger bots smoother and more efficient.
